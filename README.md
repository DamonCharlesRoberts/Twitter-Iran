</h2><i>Twitter Responses to Iran - Work in Progress</h2></i>
<p>Please note that this is a work in progress. Soon, I will add files that do NLP and unsupervised ML to this repository.</p>
<h4>Also have an R version of the script. </h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Please note that this script has a Twitter Stream. The twitter stream will pull from the Twitter API for one week and compile it into a JSON file to then be used by using PANDAS (in Python) or an R Dataframe once the document is parsed. You can then use the TextBlob library (Python) or the TidyText Package (in R) to preform Natural Lanugage Processing.</li>
